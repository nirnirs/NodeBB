Helping out the NodeBB Project
------------------------------

NodeBB is an open source project, and will forever remain free. Here's a number of ways you can help us, even if you aren't a programmer.

* `Like and share our content on Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/NodeBB>`_
* `Follow us on Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/NodeBB>`_ and perhaps tweet `#NodeBB is most awesome forum software @NodeBB`
* Update this wiki! ;) We need everything from development/design tutorials to user friendly how-to guides.
* Tell everybody about NodeBB, including your grandma and her cats.
* `Submit a pull request, or two, or three.. <http://www.github.com/designcreateplay/NodeBB>`_
* Build a new theme
* Write a plugin
* Keep the link back to us on the footer of your own NodeBB :)
* Blog about us! Give the gift of SEO juice this Christmas
* `Help Translate NodeBB <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/nodebb/>`_ - It's a really simple translation tool and you don't need to know how to code.
* Join our `community <http://community.nodebb.org>`_ and give us a hard time about bugs and missing features
